\chapter{Simulations}

Simulations of toy models were carried out to prove the correctness and to test the efficiency of FPT-BXD for the calculation of rate constants for master equation (ME) modelling.
Variations of a simple two-dimensional periodic potential with a single minimum per box are used in section 3.1.
A many-dimensional generalisation of this potential is used in section \ref{sec:manydim} to demonstrate transferability of the results to realistic systems with multiple minima per box.
FPT-BXD calculation of rate constants for a cluster of seven Lennard-Jones discs has not yet been successful, for reasons that are understood.
The current state of the simulation protocol optimisation is described in section 3.2.
