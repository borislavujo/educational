An example of simulated annealing algorithm applied to finding optimum shape of a soap membrane on a cylinder defined as:
1. a circle with radius 1 in z=0 plane
2. a circle with radius 1 in z=h plane
3. a line connecting [1,0,0] with [1,0,h]

Calculus of variations leads to a set of equations for a function of 2 variables (radius as a function of angle and z)
The optimum numerical method for this problem is a simple local optimisation algorithm.

In this implementation, radii of free nodes are randomly modified, total area is calculated as the sum of areas of all triangles.
Optimum annealing coded in C++ would modify positions of each node one by one.
This ve3ctorised implementation moves all nodes at once.
It is good to scale each random move by the distance from constraining circles/line (see randMoveCyli.m).

The main script is in bubble.m. 
Main parameters of the simulation are found therein.
All remaining procedures are implemented as octave functions.
Drawing is this complicated as splot in gnuplot is used afterwards.

Usage:
  $  octave bubble.m
  $  gnuplot graf.plt
